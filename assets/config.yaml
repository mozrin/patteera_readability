# Config for Readability Algorithm (Patteera Thesis Based)
# The paper suggests "Text difficulty was indicated by LFP (Lexical Frequency Profile)".
# Specifically, the percentage of tokens from the first three frequency bands.

algorithm:
  name: "Patteera LFP Index"
  method: "LFP" # Lexical Frequency Profile

  # Frequency Bands Definitions
  # The algorithm calculates the percentage of words in the text that appear in these lists.
  bands:
    - name: "Level 1 (0-1000)"

  # In the paper, a high percentage of words in the first 3 bands = Easier text.
  # We will sum the percentages of matched words.

  classification:
    # Based on the paper's mention of "Too Difficult" to "Too Easy"
    # These thresholds are hypothetical. The user must adjust based on Chapter 5 results.
    # Score = Sum of % coverage of defined bands (0-100)

    thresholds:
      - score: 95
        label: "Simple"
        color: "0xFF4CAF50" # Green
      - score: 90
        label: "Easy"
        color: "0xFF8BC34A" # Light Green
      - score: 80
        label: "Moderate"
        color: "0xFFFFC107" # Amber
      - score: 70
        label: "Challenging"
        color: "0xFFFF9800" # Orange
